				<h4>Music</h4>
				<p>Listening to music is my favorite past time. My music tastes come from a wide variety of genres and languages. I analyze personal changes in music taste and reflect on how those changes have come about.</p>
				

				<h4>Anime</h4>
				<p>One of the ways I like to enjoy myself and expand my creative abilities is through the viewing of anime. I watch shows from various years, and appreciate those that go above and beyond to show creative merit. In the anime club I am able to discuss positive and negative aspects of certain animes with like minded individuals. This has helped me build my analytical skills of visual media.</p>

				

				<h4>Programming</h4>
				<p>After taking EECS 101 at the University of Michigan, I became interested in computer science as a minor. Since then I have taken various classes on the subject, and will soon be complete with the requirements for a minor. My programming interests lie in website and mobile development.</p>

				

				<h4>Amateur Photography</h4>
				<p>After borrowing a Nikon D100 from my father, I became interested in using amateur photography as a way to relieve stress. I purchased a Nikon D3300 and have been learning the ins and outs of amateur photography. Some pictures I have taken are available on <a target = "_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kihatan/">Flickr</a>.</p>

				

				<h4>Board Games</h4>
				<p>While many find board games simple fun, I find them a way to build critical thinking and strategy skills. For example, games like King of Tokyo teach how to assess risk through a simple dice mechanic. Others, such as Sushi Go!, build decision making skills through simple probability problems.</p>
