Thought Questions

Why do people want to meet others on-line instead of finding them in the real world?
	Don't have to spend as much money
	People/time
	Can think through questions


Does eHarmony have a competitive advantage? If so where does it come from? Can you quantify what their advantage is over the competition? (hint what is the willingness to pay and cost for eHarmony compared to competitors)
	eHarmony has a competitive advantage because of network effects.
	This means that you can charge 10x other sites.
	Patented search algorithm
	user base compared to competitors = advantage?
	6-12 month to marriage compared to others?


Which of the four options should Waldorf pursue?
	Defend eHarmony's position
		Match.com could create a larger customer base and consume eHarmony's clients
	Broadening the customer base to include more casual daters
		Dillute brand?
		Alienate current customers?
	Growing a new business based on research
		Seems like a good idea
		Can go after a different segment
		Expensive to hire new people
	Geographic expansion into other countries
		Different Countries and dating cultures
		Match already here


Quantitative Challenge Question:

Calculate the size of eHarmonyâ€™s competitive advantage (if it exists) over Match and Yahoo!. (To do so you need estimates of revenues and costs for all three companies. It is best if you work in terms of dollars and cents per subscriber per month and avoid working in terms of percentages of revenues.)

	eHarmony
		59.95 / customer
		10% margin
		$6 / person

	Match
		39.99 / customer
		4% margin
		$4 / customer
		$5.9B @ 5% = $295,000 rev
