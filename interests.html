				<h3>Music</h3>

				<p>I have interests in a large variety of music.  While I myself do not play an instrument, I consider myself a professional listener to make up for it.  I currently listen to music anywhere between two and seven hours a day.  Some of the bands I am interested in are:</p>

				<h3>Anime</h3>
				<p>One of the ways I like to enjoy myself and expand my creative abilities is through the viewing of anime.  While many think anime is a perverted and disgusting art form, I like to look past that and focus on the creativity that it invokes.  A few of my favorite animes are:</p>

				<h3>Audio Technologies</h3>
				<p>While I do not yet have a large amount of knowledge when it comes to audio technologies, I am somewhat knowlegable when it comes to file formats.  I have purchased many speakers in my life.  The headphones I currently use are <a target = "_blank" href="http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/headphones/99aff89488ddd6b1/">Audio Technica MTH-50x</a>.</p>

				<h3>YouTube</h3>
				<p>YouTube is a major resource for people to share media across the world and across every device.  This opens up new opportunities for people to share and learn information.  In more than one situation i have used YouTube video created by persons such as <a target = "_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/khanacademy">Salaman Khan</a> to help me learn a new concept that was not clearly explained in class.  Some of my favorite channels are:</p>

				<h3>YouTube with relation to Consumer Behavior in the Modern Market</h3>
				<p>The Internet opens a wide new range of possibilites with relation to the marketing of video games.  Consumers are now able to go online and watch video game footage before commiting to buy, meaning changes in how companies produce and market their games.  With the introduction of <a target= "_blank" href = "http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/gamergate">GamerGate</a> comes a new side to how video games gain popularity.  I enjoy listening to the opinions of <a target = "_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/boogie2988">Boogie2988</a></p>

				<h3>Martial Arts</h3>
				<p>I practiced martial arts for 14 years.  I have gone through three dojos and earned both a junior black belt and a second degree black belt.  While I don not know the major players in the competitive circut, I do enjoy watching matches and martial arts movies when they are on.</p>
